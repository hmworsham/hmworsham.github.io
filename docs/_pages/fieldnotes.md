# Open Notebooks
I maintain open lab and field notebooks. The idea—crediting [Carl Boettiger](https://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/09/28/Welcome-to-my-lab-notebook.html)—is to keep a living record of my research activities and leave it open for anyone who wants to review the work in progress. Philosophically, I see this as one easy action to take in pursuit of open and reproducible science. The notes themselves may not be especially decipherable, but they constitute an accounting of thoughts, ideas, casual field observations, scribblings, preliminary analyses, draft figures, and so on, that I hope will eventually form a picture of how science takes shape.

I host the notebooks as markdown files in a Github repo. I maintain separate notebooks for different streams of work, and organize the notes within notebooks by date. As projects get bigger and more intertwined, this may change, but for now it seems to work.
