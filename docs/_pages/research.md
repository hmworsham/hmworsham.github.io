# Research areas 

## Forest structure

| ![structure](/assets/images/structure.png) | Ecologists know the general contours of the relationships between forest structure and underlying variables like topography, soil, lithology, and climate. But few studies have quantified the relative importance of these "state" variables or their potential interactive effects, particularly in subalpine forests. My research in this area helps to address this gap by analyzing covariability between measures of forest structure and state variables on a spatially continuous basis. I have used **full-waveform LiDAR** data to develop wall-to-wall estimates of stand structure. I use both inferential and Bayesian approaches to model the relationships between those metrics and spatially continuous measures of variables like site topography, lithology, soil properties, and snow water equivalent (SWE). My findings serve as a point of departure for further evaluation of nonlinearities in the elevational lapse-rate control on forest growth, and improve the quantitative basis for predicting future stand structure change. |

## Tree growth responses to climate extremes

| ![dendro-wavelet](/assets/images/dendro_wavelet.png) | Environmental and physiological factors interact to govern a forest stand’s susceptibility to drought, and they do so in ways that are both nonstationary and nonlinear. This complexity leaves gaps in the understanding of how and why drought’s effects on forest dynamics and geochemical cycling vary across a landscape. I am interested in disentangling some of these relationships, and I use dendroecology methods to do so. I'm especially interested in evaluating the **structural overshoot hypothesis**, which suggests that denser stands should experience lower soil moisture, lower individual transpiration rates, and lower growth during extended low water periods than similarly sited but sparser stands. | 

## Hydraulic redistribution

| ![soil](/assets/images/soil.jpg) | I am investigating the extent to which **hydraulic redistribution (HR)** contributes to the water physiologically available to trees in subalpine forests. I'm particularly interested in how HR’s contribution to the water budget covaries with a site’s geophysical and compositional characteristics, an underdescribed area in ecohydrology. I measure soil moisture (θ) and soil water potential (ψ) to quantify physiologically available water storage, characterize hydraulic redistribution and its effects on θ and ψ, and describe the vertical variability in the soil water characteristic (SWC) curve. I use these observations to study relationships between these subsurface hydrologic dynamics, sap flux, and other measurements of stand structure and function. |
