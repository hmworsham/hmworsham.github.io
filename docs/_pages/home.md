As a PhD candidate in the Energy and Resources Group at UC Berkeley, I study the interactions between hydrology, climate, and forest structure and function at tree-to-watershed scales. I use interdisciplinary approaches spanning remote sensing, dendrochronology, and soil science to think about how water availability influences the state and change of high-elevation conifer forests — and vice-versa.
