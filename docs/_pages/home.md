    excerpt: "Hello. I'm Marshall. I'm a PhD Candidate in the Energy and Resources Group at UC Berkeley. My research seeks to clarify the influence of environmental factors on the state and change of subalpine forest ecosystems. I use a range of approaches, spanning remote sensing, dendrochronology, and soil science, to study how environmental conditions interact to regulate structure, composition, growth, and climate response in high-elevation conifer forests of the Rocky Mountains."
